# SLeep and Environmental Exposure evaluation framework for urban Populations (SLEEP)

**This repository contains all the essential code for the SLEEP framework.**

It includes:

- üìä **[R 4.3.2](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.2/)** code for regression modeling of sleep health risks, including:
  - Obstructive sleep apnea model
  - Sleep efficiency model
- üìä ****[R 4.3.2](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.2/)** code for quantifying sleep health disparities**
- üè† **EnergyPlus `.idf` file** for integrating sleep health models into building energy simulations

These resources support simulation-based assessments of sleep-related health risks in urban residential environments.

# SLeep and Environmental Exposure evaluation framework for urban Populations (SLEEP)

**This repository contains all the essential code for the SLEEP framework.**

It includes:

- üìä **RStudio code for regression modeling of sleep health**, including:
  - Obstructive sleep apnea model
  - Sleep efficiency model
- üìä **RStudio code for quantifying sleep health disparities**
- üè† **EnergyPlus `.idf` file** for integrating sleep health models into building energy simulations

These resources support simulation-based assessments of sleep-related health risks in urban residential environments.

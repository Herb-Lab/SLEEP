# SLeep and Environmental Exposure Evaluation Framework for Urban Populations (SLEEP)

This repository contains the code corresponding to the Methods section of the manuscript **_Housing Conditions as Drivers of Pediatric Sleep Disparities in U.S. Cities_.**

It includes:

- üìä **[R 4.3.2](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.2/)** code for regression modeling of sleep health risks, including:
  - Obstructive sleep apnea model
  - Sleep efficiency model
- üìä **[R 4.3.2](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.2/)** code for quantifying sleep health disparities
- üè† **[EnergyPlus 23.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v23.2.0)  `.idf` file** with sleep health models integrated into building energy simulations
